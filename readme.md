# Aubrey Portwood's Resume

Because I tend to lose track of resume's and updates to them, I decided to version
control them. The primary resume is in the `.docx` format and it then exported into
other versions.

Version information of the document can be found in the `.docx` file under
File > Properties > Comments.
